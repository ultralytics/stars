# Count GitHub Stars per Day ‚≠ê

**Overview**: The objective of this project is to monitor and visualize the popularity of various open-source repositories by tracking the number of GitHub stars they receive daily. This kind of information can be valuable for developers and companies to understand trends in technology tools and frameworks.

## Requirements

To access the GitHub REST API from your Python code, you'll need the `PyGitHub` library. This library facilitates interaction with GitHub resources such as repositories, user profiles, and organizations.

[GitHub REST API]: https://docs.github.com/en/rest
[GitHub]: https://github.com

To install `PyGitHub`, simply run the following command, which will ensure you have all the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # installs all requirements
```

## Usage Instructions

1. First, you need a GitHub access token. Follow the guide to create one [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
2. Next, open the `count_stars.py` file.
3. There, on line 15 (L15), replace `TOKEN` with your own GitHub access token.

Once set up, to start counting stars, run the script in your terminal:

```python
python count_stars.py  # execute the script
```

## Results & Interpretation

Below is an example of the output you will receive when running the script:

```python
# The following is a formatted display of results obtained on April 10th, 2022.

Counting stars for last 30.0 days from 02 May 2022

# Sample output for a repository: 
# > [Repository owner/Repository name]: [Total stars accumulated in period] stars ([Average stars per day])  :  [Progress bar indicating completion]

...
```

Please note that the progress bar is a visual representation meant to indicate the proportion of the count completed for each repository.

I hope this enhances the clarity and appeal of your README documentation. The formatting and additional context should improve the user experience for both technical and non-technical audiences.
